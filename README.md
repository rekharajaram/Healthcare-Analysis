# Healthcare-Analysis
Every year, the CDC conducts a Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey, conducting interviews with over 400,000 adults in the US, and documenting their behavior in health-related risk factors. This is a survey analysis of aggregated BRFSS data to scope out the kinds of factors in the dataset (which contains data from ~ 450k people, with 280 variables). 

A couple of sample plots have been posted to the repository as a representation of the kinds of plots I looked at for this analyis. These are:
1. figOther_cancer_2013.png: Which shows the distribution of population with cancer across the US.
2. figmodel.png: Which shows a linear regression model from a subset of the original dataset. Looking at aggregated cancer statistics as a function of health-risk factors
